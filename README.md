# GRID BASED PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
Academic Projects
Graphical passwords refer to using pictures (also drawings) as passwords. In theory, graphical passwords are easier to remember, since humans remember pictures better
than words . Also, they should be more resistant to brute force attacks, since the search space is practically infinite. A recall - based graphical password approach 
was introduced by Greg Blonder in 1996 . In this approach, a user create a password by clicking on several grids of an image. A user is asked to reproduce something
that he created or selected at the registration stage. In our approach a user can click any point grid to create the password. During authentication, the user has to 
select the grids within the in the correct sequence to
login.


Alphanumeric passwords are the most common but they have some drawbacks.Previous studies have shown that users tend to choose short alphanumeric passwords thatare 
easy to remember (Adams and Sasse 1999) but that password can be easily guessed.On the other hand, if an alphanumeric password is hard to guess, then it is often 
hard to remember (Suo, Zhu, and Owen 2005). Since users can remember a limited number ofalphanumeric passwords, they often write down their passwords or use same 
password for multiple accounts(Kotadia2005). Alphanumeric password scheme is one of the mostcommon methods for mobile authentication. However, it has some security 
and usability drawbacks.

Graphical passwords are an alternative to textual alphanumeric password. It satisfies both conflicting requirements i.e. easy to remember and security.
